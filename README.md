# Google Image Quilts

This is a Google Chrome Extension which allows you to create "quilts" from Google image search results.

The idea comes from Edward Tufte:

> Quilting: use Google images as your search engine, full-screen the results, take screenshot, combine multiple screenshots for SuperQuilt.
